### Goal
+ Build a medium.com style commenting / notes system
+ People can mark text and attach a comment to it
+ You can assume that the editor will not change the text afterwards
+ Make it work for a single user and a static text (no signup / login needed)
+ Please use a REST-API to manage storage in a DB
+ We prefer NodeJS, React, Redux
+ please try your best to make it look good (e.g styling and transitions)
